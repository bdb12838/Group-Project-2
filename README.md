## Scenario Description (Why does this data matter?):
This database models the fighters, events, customers, and employees of the UFC so that the upper level management, like Dana White, can make decisions to drive profit and popularity. It will allow management to schedule marquee fights, improve advertising, and decide fighter bonus pay. By capturing detailed information about fightersâ€™ performance, event scheduling, customer engagement and employee responsibilities, the database that our group has created will support decision making in several areas. In conclusion, this database will be an invaluable tool for UFC management, enabling data-driven decisions that not only optimize operations but also enhance the fan experience, boost fighter performance, and ultimately drive the organization's success.
